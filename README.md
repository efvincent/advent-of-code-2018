Advent of Code 2018
===================
Warming up for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), I'm taking some time to practice on [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), to refamiliarize myself with writing in Haskell (which I don't get to use professionally). This year I'm also using a branch of [Justin Le's scaffolding for a Haskell](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-dev) project to solve AOC puzzles. 

This scaffolding integrates with the [Haskell AOC API](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api) to do things like pull down the puzzle descriptions, example input data, and puzzle data from the AOC website, and provides a consistent approach to representing a solution. With this scaffolding one can focus on solving the problem. If you're interested in AOC and Haskell, I strongly suggest looking at Justin's work. I for one find it very useful as a learning tool!
